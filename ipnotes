Link layer: UDP socket.

RIP - Handles the packet routing

'node' executable : n nodes to set up a virtual network - route packets within
itself, topology passed by config files

write a topology fila and net2lnx will split it into files for each node.

General Parts: Forwarding + Routing

Forwarding: Decapsulate the link layer packet header. (What's the link layer
        header????, Since I am doing on the Network Layer, so that it cannot
        see the header of Link Layer, it only deals with headers of the IP
        Layer because equal layers deal with their headers, which is their
        responsibility).



RIP and upper layer: If the router is not the destination or is not in the
                    subnet of the destination, it will call RIP. If the router
                    is in the destination, so it will pass the packet to the
                    upper layer (TCP), which is the next project's work. So in
                    this project, just print the packet arriving the
                    destination out. In order to work with upper layer, we
                    should writer an interface which allows an upper layer to
                    register a handler for a given protocol number.


RIP: the routing part. The RIP has defined a data structure for routers to
    communicate to each other so that they can learn the up-to-date network
    topology.


Why in the .lnx file, each not has multiple virtual ip address?
